1. Connect your wallet on the platform.

2. Purchase a membership by clicking "Join" on the desired listed club. If your balance is sufficient, you will be prompted to sign for the payment. With this payment, a club NFT is minted to your wallet, containing metadata indicating the club you've subscribed to, for example, "type": "Literature".

3. After getting the NFT, you are now subscribed to the club and can enter it. Inside, you'll find a common video lounge where club members can interact with each other.

4. Additionally, fundraising events for the club are listed below, which you can support through funding via ADA. A shared calendar is available for viewing all scheduled events.
